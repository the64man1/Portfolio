# Portfolio

This is the first draft of my portfolio. You can follow the projects links to GitHub pages of some of my work completed in my first 3 weeks of my coding bootcamp.
You can also follow the links at the bottom of the page to view my LinkedIn, GitHub, and email. As instructed, I completed this assignment with no starter code; as such, my portfolio does not have quite the same numbers of features or level of sophistication of the sample, but it does satisfy grading requirements. I also have not updated my resume, so the resume link is inactive.
